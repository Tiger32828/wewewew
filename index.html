  <p style = "font-size:18px;">I am a junior studying Computer Science and Data Science at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. My interest is to apply my data science and programming knowledge to solve real-life problems on different fields. </p>

  <p style = "font-size:18px;">Currently, I'm working in the <a href = "https://socr.umich.edu/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow"> Statistics Online Computational Resource (SOCR) Lab </a> to build an interactive data analysis platform <a href = "https://socr.umich.edu/HTML5/SOCRAT/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow"> SOCRAT </a>, supervised by <a href = "https://www.socr.umich.edu/people/dinov/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow"> Prof. Ivo Dinov </a>.
  I'm also doing an entrepreneur project to build a story-themed social APP and I'm responsible for building up the front-end and databases.
  Previously, I was a data enigneer intern at <a href = "https://www.xiaohongshu.com/en" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow"> Xiaohongshu  </a> and a data analyst at <a href = "https://www.datastory.com.cn/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow"> DataStory </a>.</p?

  <p style = "font-size:18px;"> During spare time, I love to discover the beauty of the world. I used to be a travel blogger with 100k views and have been to 30+ countries. </p>
