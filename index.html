  <h1 id="intro">About Me</h1>
  <div>
  </div>
  <p style = "font-size:18px;">I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Washington, Seattle, advised by <a href = "https://ajratner.github.io/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow">Prof. Alex Ratner</a>. Before that, I was an undergraduate student in Computer Science of University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I was fortunated to be advised by <a href = "http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow">Prof. Jiawei Han</a>. </p>

  <p style = "font-size:18px;">My current research interests are <b>Data Management for Machine Learning</b> and <b>Weak Supervision</b> (check out this <a href="https://github.com/JieyuZ2/Awesome-Weak-Supervision" target = "_blank">survey repo</a> and this <a href="https://github.com/JieyuZ2/wrench" target = "_blank">benchmark</a> to learn more about Weak Supervision) with an emphasis on effort-light approach. My ultimate goal is to build an effective, efficient and explainable system to facilitate new machine learning tasks by leveraging knowledge in the form of heuristics, labels and trained models. My past explorations lay in the intersection of data mining, machine learning and natural language processing.</p>

  <p style = "font-size:18px;">Feel free to drop me an e-mail if you are interested in my research and want to discuss relevant research topic or potential collaborations.</p>
